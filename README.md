A 4-week internship based on VSDSquadron mini RISC-V Board based on RV32EC ISA .


# TASK 1 :

## Installation of RISC-V toolchain using VDI. Writing a C code and compiling using RISC-V compiler and uploading snapshots 

so below are the steps to complete task 1 

### 1. Installation of Oracle Virtualbox and open the terminal

using this click on the left column tab to open the terminal


### 2 . Writing C code, its compilation and output
Now write a C code to count the numbers from 1 to n using leafpad editor 
command for it is **leafpad sum1ton.c** and write c code,save it and compile using **gcc sum1ton.c** and run simulation using **./a.out**





### 3. Running the C code using RISC-V
